libnoise2
=========

C++, noise-generating, header-only library inspired by the libnoise library. Its aim is to provide various noise generating algorithms optimized for modern CPU architectures using SSE and AVX instruction sets. It also tries to keep the original public API of the libnoise library unchanged as much as possible to allow easy "Plug-and-Play"
